Network Engineer

**Software Used**
Nmap (Network Mapper)

**Required Operating System**
Kali Linux

**Project Description**
The project focuses on scanning and examining a website on the target and identifying its vulnerabilities and potential security weaknesses utilizing the Network Mapper tool implemented in the kali Linux OS. At first, I was engaged as a Network Engineer and obtained permission from the client for scanning, testing, and various other tasks. Obtaining permission from the client is essential.

Before performing any scanning or testing activities, proper written permission was obtained from the client, ensuring that all actions were carried out ethically, legally, and within the scope of the engagement. 
Client permission is a crucial component when performing any type of penetration testing or network analysis.

The project involved:
Understanding the website’s network structure

Running various Nmap scans
Identifying open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities

Reporting findings for security improvement
This work helped in improving the website’s security posture by highlighting areas that required updates, patching, or enhancements.

⚠️**Legal & Ethical Disclaimer**
This project was conducted strictly with client authorization.
Unauthorized scanning or probing of networs/websites is illegal and unethical.
Always ensure explicit permission before performing any form of security testing.
